                        <p>He got on a train, and had a first class ticket. When an Englishman entered the train and saw this person in the first class, the Englishman got very mad. The Englishman called a railway official and told this person to go to the third-class car, where the Englishman thought he belonged. He refused to go, but the Englishman came back with a police, who kicked this person out of the train, onto the train station. How would you react if you were in this situation? This man who went through this struggle is Mahatma Gandhi. He reacted to this by staying there, in the train station, the whole night, meditating. 
                        Today we all think of Mahatma Gandhi as a Strong, Unafraid and Unstoppable leader, but he was not always like this. When he was young, he had many fears just like any other kid. His values shaped him into a great leader, which is why he is my greatest inspiration. Mahatma Gandhi had many great qualities which made him who he was. In the next few minutes I am going to tell you about some of his values that anyone can follow.</p>
                        
                       <p>Gandhi organized people towards good causes. Gandhi fought for twenty one years to get indians in South Africa equal rights. He also got India independence from Great Britain by not following some of its laws. Gandhi influences me, because anyone, including me, can be a leader just like him if we lead people toward a good cause.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading"> GETTING ALONG</h2>
                        <p>At first the settlers took the Native Americans as enemies. They were violent with each other.But after a while the settlers traded pots, pans, and copper to make jewelry in exchange for food. But unfortunately things got rough again and the settlers and the Native Americans  had war for forty years ! But thankfully Pocahontas married John Rohlf to bring peace between the people.</p>
                       <h2 class="section-heading">Women</h2>
                        <p>The women came to Jamestown in 1620 on a ship called the “Bride Ship”. They had come to marry men and give birth to children so they don't have to keep sending them. They had the dream to marry a wealthy man with a lot of land. They were not to vote or be in the government. All they did was cook, take care of children, and sew clothes. But in lots of different ways, the hard work of the Women was an important part of the growth of Jamestown.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Africans</h2>
                        <p>The Portuguese brought Africans from present day Angola. They were taken prisoners and were brought to Jamestown.They were to be sold against their will. They were taken as slaves. The settlers made them work in the fields. They helped grow the tobacco economy.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Leaders/famous people</h2>

                            <li>Pocahontas- Learned English and talked to the settlers. Favorite daughter of Chief Powhatan.</li>

                        </ul>
                       <p>These are a few of the people I know about.</p>
                       <h2 class="section-heading">VA's first laws</h2>
                       <p>According to Virginia studies weekly - House of burgesses these are the first set of laws in Virginia.</p>

                           <li>The men can not go more than twenty miles away from their home or be absent for more than seven days without the governor knowing.</li>
                           <li>If a man gambles with a dice or cards, he will lose all winnings and pay a fine. Some of that fine will go to whoever reported it. The other bit is given to the charity.</li>
                       </ul>
                       <h2 class="section-heading">Food</h2>
                       <p>The Jamestown Settlers fished a certain type of fish. That fish is the American Sturgeon. They also caught  rays, herons, gulls, oysters, raccoons, and other creatures in Virginia.</p>
