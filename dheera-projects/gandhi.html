                        <p>He got on a train, and had a first class ticket. When an Englishman entered the train and saw this person in the first class, the Englishman got very mad. The Englishman called a railway official and told this person to go to the third-class car, where the Englishman thought he belonged. He refused to go, but the Englishman came back with a police, who kicked this person out of the train, onto the train station. How would you react if you were in this situation? This man who went through this struggle is Mahatma Gandhi. He reacted to this by staying there, in the train station, the whole night, meditating. 
                        Today we all think of Mahatma Gandhi as a Strong, Unafraid and Unstoppable leader, but he was not always like this. When he was young, he had many fears just like any other kid. His values shaped him into a great leader, which is why he is my greatest inspiration. Mahatma Gandhi had many great qualities which made him who he was. In the next few minutes I am going to tell you about some of his values that anyone can follow.</p>
                        
                       <p>Gandhi organized people towards good causes. Gandhi fought for twenty one years to get indians in South Africa equal rights. He also got India independence from Great Britain by not following some of its laws. Gandhi influences me, because anyone, including me, can be a leader just like him if we lead people toward a good cause.</p>
                      
                        <p>“An eye for eye will only make the world blind” said Mahatma Gandhi. He always wanted to make friends instead of enemies. Remember when I told you about the official complaining about gandhi? Well, much later Gandhi gave that same oficial a pair of leather sandals that he made as a gift. When he did not like the laws that the British made, he would protest by boycotting the laws in a non-violent manner. When he was sixty years old he led a group of followers for over a month in very hot conditions to the sea. This was to protest over the salt act which was unaffordable to the Indians. This quality of Gandhi has taught me to be nice to everyone and to be patient.</p>
                      
                        <p>Gandhi was an inspiration to many, including other great leaders. Nelson Mandela followed in Gandhi’s non-violent footsteps and got freedom for South Africa from Great Britain. He was in the prison for twenty seven years! Can you imagine how difficult that would have been? Martin Luther King Jr. was inspired by Mahatma Gandhi and wanted to be like him. He fought for civil liberties and equal treatment for African Americans. Being an inspiration to many such leaders makes Mahatma Gandhi one of the greatest leaders. He certainly inspires me to do the right things!</p>
                        
                        <p>As a 9 year old, I have many fears that I need to overcome to become a strong girl. After learning about Gandhi, I am inspired to be Fearless and follow the values and qualities that his life has taught us. Thank you for listening to me today, good bye.</p>
