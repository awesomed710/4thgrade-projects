                    <div class="col-md-10 col-lg-8 col-xl-7">
                        <h2 class="section-heading">HOW THEY CAME</h2>
                        <p>In 1607 England sent three ships to the new world. The ships were the Sousan Constant, Godspeed, and the Discovery.The Sousan Constant was the largest ship. The second largest was the Godspeed. The smallest one was the Discovery. Inside the ships were one hundred and four settlers and many crates of food. The settlers were starting a long and hard journey.</p>
                         <h2 class="section-heading">SURVIVING</h2>
                       <p>During the winter of 1609 - 1610 more than half of the settlers died. This is known as the Starving Time. Many of them died from disease or violence. The Native Americans also surrounded the fort to prevent the settlers from getting food. Later the settlers started trade relationships with the Native Americans. The Native Americans  
taught the settlers how to plant corn and harvest tobacco to help them.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading"> GETTING ALONG</h2>
                        <p>At first the settlers took the Native Americans as enemies. They were violent with each other.But after a while the settlers traded pots, pans, and copper to make jewelry in exchange for food. But unfortunately things got rough again and the settlers and the Native Americans  had war for forty years ! But thankfully Pocahontas married John Rohlf to bring peace between the people.</p>
                       <h2 class="section-heading">Women</h2>
                        <p>The women came to Jamestown in 1620 on a ship called the “Bride Ship”. They had come to marry men and give birth to children so they don't have to keep sending them. They had the dream to marry a wealthy man with a lot of land. They were not to vote or be in the government. All they did was cook, take care of children, and sew clothes. But in lots of different ways, the hard work of the Women was an important part of the growth of Jamestown.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Africans</h2>
                        <p>The Portuguese brought Africans from present day Angola. They were taken prisoners and were brought to Jamestown.They were to be sold against their will. They were taken as slaves. The settlers made them work in the fields. They helped grow the tobacco economy.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Leaders/famous people</h2>
                        <p><There were many leaders in the Jamestown period./p>
                        <ul>

                            <li>Captain John Smith- He led many trade expeditions. Learned Algonquean from Pocahontas.</li>
                            <li>Pocahontas- Learned English and talked to the settlers. Favorite daughter of Chief Powhatan.</li> 
                            <li>Chief Powhatan - leader of many native tribes.Father of Pocahontas.</li>
                        </ul>
                       <p>These are a few of the people I know about.</p>
                       <h2 class="section-heading">VA's first laws</h2>
                       <p>According to Virginia studies weekly - House of burgesses these are the first set of laws in Virginia.</p>
                       <ul>
                           <li>Everyone must go to church every Sunday morning and evening.</li>

                           <li>You can not sell dogs to the Indians.</li>
                           <li>Everyone can trade with the Indians except the servants. If they trade they will be whipped.</li>
                           <li>The men can not go more than twenty miles away from their home or be absent for more than seven days without the governor knowing.</li>
                           <li>If a man gambles with a dice or cards, he will lose all winnings and pay a fine. Some of that fine will go to whoever reported it. The other bit is given to the charity.</li>
                       </ul>
                       <h2 class="section-heading">Food</h2>
                       <p>The Jamestown Settlers fished a certain type of fish. That fish is the American Sturgeon. They also caught  rays, herons, gulls, oysters, raccoons, and other creatures in Virginia.</p>
                       <h2 class="section-heading">Fun Facts</h2>
